## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. I have changed:

- Conformed `Authors@R` to CRAN guidelines
- Cited researchers of the base papers and linked the paper in DESCRIPTION
- Included Acknowledgments in README
- Remove graphs from the `./vignettes/segmentr.R` file to avoid graphical device error

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
