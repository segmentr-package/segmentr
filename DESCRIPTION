Title: Segment Data With Maximum Likelihood
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Thales Mello
Maintainer: Thales Mello <thalesmello@gmail.com>
Description: Given a likelihood provided by the user, this package applies it
    to a given matrix dataset in order to find changepoints in the data that
    maximize the sum of the likelihoods of all the segments. This package provides
    a handful of algorithms with different time complexities and assumption compromises
    so the user is able to choose the best one for the problem at hand.
