#' Segment data into exact changepoints
#'
#' Find changespoints in data calculating the penalized likelihood for all possible
#' segment combinations
#'
#' Function that implements the dynamic programming algorithm, with the intent
#' of finding points of independent changepoints for which the log likelihood
#' function is maximized. It analyzes all possible combinations, returning the
#' changepoints that are garanteed to segment the data matrix in the maximum
#' likelihood independent changepoints. Because it analyzes all possible combinations
#' of changepoionts, it has a quadratic algorithm complexity, meaning it works
#' in an acceptable computation time, whereas time increases quadratically,
#' being quite long for longer data sequences one wish to apply. For longer datasets,
#' the hierarchical algorithm might be more adequate.
