#' Efficient Logarithmic Discrete Multivariate Likelihood estimation
#'
#' Estimate the likelihood of a given segment using the discrete multivariate
#' estimation, implemmented efficiently in C++
#'
#' Calculates the discrete log likelihood multivariate estimation of a data
#' matrix using an algorithm implemented in C++ for performance. This is
#' intented to be used in conjunction with [segment()], as the log likelihood
#' function is executed multiple times, which makes it the bottleneck of the
#' computation. Because the multivariate is so commonly used, this efficient
#' implementation is provided.
#'
#' @param data Matrix to estimate the multivariate of. Each row is considered to
#'   be an observation, and each column is considered to be a different
#'   variable.
#' @param na_action A function that is applied to the `data` parameter. Defaults to
#'   removing columsn with NA.
#' @return the estimate of the Discrite Maximum Likelyhood for the dataframe
#'   provided.
