# segmentr

[![Travis-CI Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/thalesmello/segmentr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thalesmello/segmentr)

Given a likelihood provided by the user, this package applies it to a
given matrix dataset in order to find change points in the data that
maximize the sum of the likelihoods of all the segments.

This package provides a handful of algorithms with different time
complexities and assumption compromises so the user is able to choose
the best one for the problem at hand.

## Installation

Install the package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("segmentr")
```

## Example

Sample code using the package to identify change points in the segments’
averages:

``` r
require(segmentr)
#> Loading required package: segmentr

make_segment <- function(n, p) matrix(rbinom(100 * n, 1, p), nrow = 100)
data <- cbind(make_segment(5, 0.1), make_segment(10, 0.9), make_segment(2, 0.1))
mean_lik <- function(X) abs(mean(X) - 0.5) * ncol(X)^2
segment(data, likelihood = mean_lik, algorithm = "hieralg")
#> Segments (total of 3):
#> 
#> 1:5
#> 6:15
#> 16:17
```

## Dissertation

The work behind this package is available as a [web
book](https://segmentr-package.github.io/segmentr/book/).

## Acknowledgments

This package is part of a Master’s degree research thesis at
[IME-USP](https://www.ime.usp.br/), with [Florencia
Leonardi](https://www.ime.usp.br/~leonardi/Home_page_of_Florencia_G._Leonardi/Home_Page.html)
as thesis adviser.

The algorithms in this package are based on a
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01756) by Bruno M. de Castro and
[Florencia
Leonardi](https://www.ime.usp.br/~leonardi/Home_page_of_Florencia_G._Leonardi/Home_Page.html).

The `berlin` sample dataset was provided by [© Deutscher
Wetterdienst](https://dwd.de/) and put together with the
[`rdwd`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rdwd) package by [Berry
Boessenkool](https://github.com/brry). Check
[`make_berlin.R`](https://github.com/thalesmello/segmentr/blob/master/make_berlin.R)
for the script that builds the dataset.
