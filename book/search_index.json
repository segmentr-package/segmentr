This work expands on that by minimizing a cost function rather than maximizing a likelihood function, such the cost is the opposite of the likelihood. We show this generalization can be used for other use-cases, e.g. segments with homogeneous values (see Chapter 4.2), segments that have the same linear regression trend 5. This work was developed as an R Programming Language (R Core Team 2018) package. The packaging of the code into redistributable software was based on instructions provided by (Wickham 2015), and the final code is made available as an R package (Mello and Leonardi 2019). The goal was to make it as easy as possible for researchers and R programmers to use this software. The source code for the package is also available as an open-source software Mello (2019). Finally, as a special implementation for the use case described by (Castro et al. 2018) of segmenting finite alphabets, a specialized version of the multivariate likelihood function is implemented in native code using Rcpp (Eddelbuettel and François 2011). 1.1 Related Work (Maidstone et al. 2017) also talks about optimally segmenting a data set with the minimization of a given cost function. In their paper, they discuss search path algorithms different than the ones shown in this work. In their case, if the cost function satisfies certain conditions, the fpop and snip search algorithms can prune the search path in a mathematically optimal way. They claim the algorithms presented in their work provide better results than previous work. Notice that, because the approach used by (Maidstone et al. 2017) is different than the one used by (Castro et al. 2018), the fpop and snip algorithms couldn’t be investigated and validated in time to be implemented in the Segmentr package. However, if in future work those algorithms provide good results estimation and performance compared to the currently implemented algorithms, they can be included in the Segmentr package. That will allow users to use the newly implemented algorithms with minimal code modification, by changing a single parameter. References "],
["main-definition.html", "2 Main Definition 2.1 A sequence of random variables and its segments 2.2 The segmentation problem 2.3 The Hausdorff distance", " 2 Main Definition In this chapter, we explain the problem by providing definitions of concepts and build equations that gradually help us explain the problem and make the case for our solution. 2.1 A sequence of random variables and its segments As shown in defined in (2.1), let \\(X=(X_1, \\dots , X_m)\\), be a vector of random variables whose elements \\(X_j\\) belong to a set \\(S\\). The equation also shows all random variables \\(X_j\\) have probability distribution \\(F\\), each with parameter \\(\\Theta_j\\), such that \\(X_j \\sim F(\\Theta_j)\\). A segment is defined as a sequence of indices for which \\(\\Theta_a = \\Theta_{a+1} = \\dots = \\Theta_b\\) such that \\(1 \\le a \\le b \\le m\\), for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as the first and last indices of the segment, respectively. We also define a change point \\(c\\) as being an index for which there is a change in the probability distribution parameters, i.e. \\(\\Theta_{c-1} \\ne \\Theta_c\\), for \\(c \\ge 2\\). \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} X= (X_1, \\dots , X_m) \\\\ X_j\\in S, \\text{ for } 1 \\le j \\le m \\text{ and } j \\in \\mathbb Z\\\\ X_j\\sim F(\\Theta_j) \\end{gathered} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Putting it all together in (2.2), a data set \\(X\\) with \\(t\\) change points has each segment represented by the sequence \\(S_k = X_{c_k}, \\dots, X_{c_{k+1}-1}\\), with \\(c_k\\) each representing a change point when \\(k \\le 1\\). In order to simplify equations, let \\(c_0 = 1\\) and \\(c_{t+1} = m + 1\\), even though they are not change points. With it we say \\(S_{c_0} = S_1\\) represents the first segment of the data set, even though \\(c_0\\) is not a change point. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} c_0 = 1\\\\ c_{t+1} = m + 1 \\\\ 1 &lt;c_{1} &lt;\\dots &lt;c_k &lt;\\dots &lt;c_t &lt;m + 1 \\\\, \\text{ for } 0 \\le k \\le t \\text{ and } k \\in \\mathbb Z\\\\ \\Theta_{c_k} = \\Theta_{c_k+1} = \\dots = \\Theta_{c_{k+1}-1} \\\\ \\Theta_{c_k - 1} \\ne \\Theta_{c_k}, \\text{ for } 1 \\le k \\le t \\text{ and } k \\in \\mathbb Z\\\\ S_k = X_{c_k}, \\dots, X_{c_{k+1}-1} \\end{gathered} \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] 2.2 The segmentation problem As defined in (2.3), let \\(D\\) be a \\(n \\times m\\) matrix with elements \\(x_{i,j}\\), with row and column indices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), respectively. Each of the \\(n\\) rows in the data matrix \\(D\\) is a sample of the vector of random variables \\(X\\), i.e. any row element with column index \\(j\\) is a sample of the random variable \\(X_j\\). In (2.4), let \\(C\\) is the set of change points in the data set. Considering all random variables within a segment have the same probability function parameter, let \\(K\\) be a cost function that calculates the cost value for a segment \\(S_k\\) with estimated parameter \\(\\Theta_k\\), i.e. the calculated cost is minimal when the estimated \\(\\Theta_k\\) is optimal for the segment \\(S_k\\). Therefore, a common definition for \\(K\\) is the opposite of the maximum value of a log-likelihood function, illustrated in (2.5). \\[\\begin{equation} D = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{11} &amp; \\dots &amp; x_{1j} &amp; \\dots &amp; x_{1m} \\\\ \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots \\\\ x_{i1} &amp; \\dots &amp; x_{ij} &amp; \\dots &amp; x_{im} \\\\ \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots &amp; \\dots \\\\ x_{n1} &amp; \\dots &amp; x_{nj} &amp; \\dots &amp; x_{nm} \\end{bmatrix}_{n \\times m} \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} C = \\{ c_1, \\dots, c_t \\} \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\Theta_k = arg\\,max\\left\\{L(\\Theta|S_k)\\right\\} \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] Let the total cost of the segments \\(T\\), i.e. the sum of all segment costs, as illustrated in (2.6). So, the segmentation problem is defined as estimating the optimal set of change points \\(C\\) that minimize the total cost \\(T\\), as described in (2.7). Notice that, in (2.6) and in (2.7), the cost function \\(K\\) and the data set \\(D\\) are parameters to the segmentation problem, which will ultimately be used to search for the set of change points \\(C\\) using dynamic programming. So, let \\(s(K, D) = C\\) be the segmentation function whose output is the estimation of change points, as illustrated in (2.7). The segmentr package implements a few different segmentation function algorithms, which are described in this work. \\[\\begin{equation} T = \\sum_{k=0}^t K(S_k) \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} C = arg\\,min\\left\\{ T \\right\\} = arg\\,min\\left\\{ \\sum_{k=0}^t K(S_k) \\right\\} \\tag{2.7} \\end{equation}\\] In summary, segmentr is a generalization of the work described in (Castro et al. 2018), in which the random variables of \\(X\\) are taken from finite alphabets and \\(L\\) is the multivariate estimate of discrete variables. In this work, with the difference that we minimize a cost function rather than maximize a cost function, we solve the same problem proposed by (Castro et al. 2018), with the difference the cost function concept can be applied to many other use cases as well, e.g. segments with changes in the mean of columns, segments with different linear regression parameters. These cases are discussed in 4 and 5. 2.3 The Hausdorff distance As the solution estimated by the segmentation function is a set of points, a measure is made necessary to compare the estimations provided by the different estimation algorithms that will be presented in Chapter 3. The Hausdorff distance is commonly used as a measure of distance between two distinct sets, and will be used to to compare change point sets with differing numbers of elements each. (Munkres 2000) defines the Hausdorff distance as a measure of how far two subsets from a metric space are from one another. It’s defined as the biggest of all the distances from a point in one set to the closest point in the other set, which is expressed mathematically by the equation defined in (2.8), in which \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) represent sets given as inputs to the function, \\(d(x, y)\\) represents a distance function defined in the metric space \\(S\\) such that \\(x, y \\in S\\). \\[\\begin{equation} d_H(X,Y) = \\max\\left\\{\\,\\sup_{x \\in X} \\inf_{y \\in Y} d(x,y)\\, ,\\, \\sup_{y \\in Y} \\inf_{x \\in X} d(x,y)\\,\\right\\} \\tag{2.8} \\end{equation}\\] Since a set of change points is a subset of the column indices in a data set, we define the distance \\(d\\) as the absolute value of two given numbers for the use cases analyzed in this paper.

["solution-estimation.html", "3 Solution Estimation 3.1 Exact Algorithm 3.2 Hierarchical Algorithm 3.3 Hybrid algorithm", " 3 Solution Estimation In this chapter, we discuss the process to solve (2.7) and explore a solution involving dynamic programming. Because the exact solution to this problem has quadratic complexity, we also discuss some alternatives that simplify the search path and provide an approximate solution. 3.1 Exact Algorithm The first attempt to solve the equation would be to search all the possible alternatives to find the correct minimal set of intervals that minimize the total cost of the system. It’s done iteratively by: let \\(D\\) be the current data set we want to segment for each column index \\(i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}\\) for each column index \\(j \\in \\{i, \\dots, m\\}\\) compute \\(K_{i:j}=K(D_{i:j})\\) store the cost \\(K_{i:j}\\) and the index \\(j\\) for the lowest value of \\(K_{i:j}\\) for later comparison Finally, after computing all of the possible combinations of segment costs, the procedure to find the optimal solution is: let \\(j = m\\) while \\(j &gt; 1\\) search the stored values for \\(i = \\underset{i}{\\arg\\min} (K_{i:j})\\) store \\(i\\) in the set of change points \\(C\\) if \\(i \\ne 1\\) let \\(j = i\\) and repeat until \\(j = 1\\) With the execution of the procedure described above, the estimated set of change points is stored in \\(C\\). The solution will be exact precisely because it analyses all the possible combinations. However, that has a time complexity of \\(O(m^2)\\) in the Big-O notation, for a number of column \\(m\\) in the data set. Because the number of columns in a data segmentation problems can be very large, computation time can be very prohibitive. For those situations approximate solutions are described. 3.2 Hierarchical Algorithm To try to simplify the search path of the algorithm, (Castro et al. 2018) also proposes a technique that relies on the assumption of the data hierarchical, i.e. a segment can be sub-divided by reapplying the segmentation function recursively. The algorithm is described as: let \\(D\\) be the current data set we want to segment for each column \\(i\\) in the data set compute the total cost \\(K_i = K(D_{1:i-1})+K(D_{i:m})\\) if \\(i \\ne 1\\) find \\(i\\) for which \\(K_i\\) is minimum if \\(K_i &gt;K(D_{1:m})\\) return the empty set as the result of current function call recursively find the set of change points \\(C_L\\) by calling the algorithm on the left segment \\(D_{1:i-1}\\) recursively find the set of change points \\(C_R\\) by calling the algorithm on the right segment \\(D_{i:m}\\) return \\(C=C_L \\cup C_R \\cup \\{i\\}\\) as result of current function call Implementing the algorithm described above will estimate the set of change points \\(C\\) with time complexity of \\(O(m\\log(m))\\), for a number of columns \\(m\\) in the data set. The reduction in time complexity is only possible because of the strong assumption the data set has a hierarchical cost behavior. However, that doesn’t hold for many situations, as it will be seen in more detail in the next chapters. So, the usage of this algorithm should be considered with care. 3.3 Hybrid algorithm The hybrid algorithm is a modified version of the hierarchical algorithm, in which it will start searching the segments using the hierarchical algorithm, and if the segments become smaller than a certain number of columns threshold, it will switch to the exact algorithm. The procedure would be as follow: let \\(D\\) be the current data set we want to segment if the number of columns of \\(D\\) is \\(m &lt;k\\), in which \\(k\\) is a predefined threshold return the set of change points calculated by the exact algorithm. for each column \\(i\\) in the data set compute the total cost \\(K_i = K(D_{1:i-1})+K(D_{i:m})\\) if \\(i \\ne 1\\) find \\(i\\) for which \\(K_i\\) is minimum if \\(K_i &lt;K(X_{1:p})\\) return empty set as result of current function call recursively find the set of change points \\(C_L\\) by calling the algorithm on the left segment \\(K_{1:i-1}\\) recursively find the set of change points \\(C_R\\) by calling the algorithm on the right segment \\(K_{i:m}\\) return \\(C=C_L \\cup C_R \\cup \\{i\\}\\) as result of current function call The only difference between this and the hierarchical procedure is the presence of the conditional step in the beginning of the procedure that tests whether or not to use the hybrid algorithm. As it will be shown in later chapters, the accuracy of this algorithm is shown not to be more advantageous than using the hierarchical or the exact algorithms directly, depending on the situation.

["simulations.html", "4 Simulations 4.1 Segments of Independent Variables 4.2 Segments with similar averages 4.3 Accuracy of algorithms using different algorithms", " 4 Simulations To exemplify the utility of this package, a handful of hypothetical data will be presented, together with a proposal of an appropriate cost function that is expected to segment the data. 4.1 Segments of Independent Variables To show compatibility with the work presented in (Castro et al. 2018), we analyze the same problem presented in their work. Let \\(N = (N_1, \\dots , N_6)\\) be a sequence of independent random variables with standard normal distributions and let \\(X = (X_1, \\dots , X_15)\\) be another sequence of random variables dependent on \\(N\\), with relationships described in (4.1). From the relationships, it’s possible to see the first segment \\(X_1, ..., X_5\\) depend on \\(N_1, N_2\\), the second segment \\(X_6, ..., X_{10}\\) depend on \\(N_3, N_4\\) and the third and last segment \\(X_{11}, ..., X_{15}\\) depend on \\(X_4, X_5\\). Therefore, the set of change points for \\(X\\) is \\(C = {6, 11}\\). \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} X_1 &amp; = N_1 \\\\ X_2 &amp; = N_1 - N_2 \\\\ X_3 &amp; = N_2 \\\\ X_4 &amp; = N_1 + N_2 \\\\ X_5 &amp; = N_1 \\\\ X_6 &amp; = N_3 \\\\ X_7 &amp; = N_3 - N_4 \\\\ X_8 &amp; = N_4 \\\\ X_9 &amp; = N_3 + N_4 \\\\ X_{10} &amp; = N_3 \\\\ X_{11} &amp; = N_5 \\\\ X_{12} &amp; = N_5 - N_6 \\\\ X_{13} &amp; = N_6 \\\\ X_{14} &amp; = N_5 + N_6 \\\\ X_{15} &amp; = N_5 \\end{aligned} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] Given \\(D\\), illustrated in 4.1, a sample data set of the sequence of random variables \\(X\\), the multivariate likelihood function \\(L\\) (Park 2017) can be used to estimate the likelihood of a given segment in the discrete data set, as described in (4.2). The multivariate() is a fast native-code implementation of that function that is available in the segmentr package. We then use that likelihood function to define a penalized cost \\(K\\) in (4.3) with an extra term to penalize segments that are too large, based on the number of columns \\(\\text{ncol}(D)\\) of the segment. \\[\\begin{equation} \\log(L(X|D)) = \\sum_{k=0}^t P(X_{c_k:c_{k+1}-1} = D_{c_k:c_{k+1}-1}) \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} K(D) = - \\log(L(D)) + \\text{ncol}(D) \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] Therefore, the cost function \\(K\\) applied over a sample \\(D\\), shown in of \\(X\\) provides the same set of expected change points \\(C\\), as Table 4.2 show. Notice it’s important to use a penalized cost function because the original likelihood function tends to favor bigger segments. An estimate of the segments using an unpenalized cost is shown in Table 4.3. (ref:sample-columns-caption) Sample values of the correlated random variables defined in (4.1). Table 4.1: Sample values of the correlated random variables defined in (4.1).

First index Last index 1 1 15 4.2 Segments with similar averages (Ceballos et al. 2018) describes a process on how to find windows of contiguous homozygosity, i.e. segments in the genetic data in which the alleles are of the same type. This is of interest to a researcher investigating diseases. Considering this problems scenario, segmentr can be used to segment random variables \\(X_1, ..., X_m\\) that represent genetic data, encoded as zero for homozygosity and one for heterozygosity, i.e. \\(0\\) when the alleles are the same and \\(1\\) when different. So, to use segmentr to solve this problem, it’s necessary to find a cost function that favors segments the homogeneity of a given segment. That problem is approached by proposing a heterogeneity cost function, i.e. a function that penalized the segments whose elements are far from the segment average. One such function is defined in (4.4). Notice, however, the cost function proposed favors single column segments, as it’s the size for which all the elements approximate the segment average the most. To counter this undesirable behavior, we penalized the function by adding a constant to it, as described in (4.5). The constant factor has the effect of adding up when too many segments are considered in the estimation process, making it so wider segments end being picked up in the estimation process. In order to observe how the proposed function behaves, consider the simple example defined in (4.6), in which \\(X_i\\) for \\(i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 20\\}\\) represent each a column indexed by \\(i\\) of a data set \\(D\\), and \\(\\text{Bern(p)}\\) representing the Bernoulli distribution with probability \\(p\\). The result for applying (4.5) over (4.6) is shown in Table 4.4. \\[\\begin{equation} K(D)=\\sum_i(D_i-E[D])^2 \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} K_p(D)=K(D) + 1 \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} X_{1} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\\\ X_{2} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\\\ X_{3} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\\\ X_{4} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\\\ X_{5} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\\\ X_{6} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{7} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{8} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{9} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{10} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{11} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{12} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{13} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{14} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{15} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.1) \\\\ X_{16} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\\\ X_{17} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\\\ X_{18} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\\\ X_{19} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\\\ X_{20} &amp; \\sim \\text{Bern}(0.9) \\end{aligned} \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] Table 4.4: Results of segmentation by applying the cost function defined in (4.5) to a sample of size 10 of the model defined in (4.6).

For that, the Hausdorff distance, defined in Chapter 2.3, can be used to measure a distance between two sets of estimated change points. We want to measure how well the different algorithms provided in the segmentr package find the segments in the example correlated columns simulated data set described in (4.1). Since the simulation was arbitrarily built, we know what the exact solution to the segmentation problem is.

We notice the “exact” algorithm manages to properly match the expected change points solution, whereas the “hierarchical” algorithm finds an extra segment, which causes the Hausdorff distance to be bigger than zero. The two “hybrid” algorithm cases are interesting in the sense it that it shows how to algorithm works by either adopting the exact or the hierarchical algorithm depending on the threshold and the size of the segment being analyzed. When the threshold argument is large, it applies the exact algorithm to the data set, whereas when the threshold is small, it applies the hierarchical algorithm instead. Consider now the simulated data set of segments with similar averages described in equation (4.6). We do the same algorithm comparison with this data set in Table 4.6. In contrast with the previous experiment, all the algorithms manage to find the expected solution to the problem.

The data was obtained using data found in (Wetterdienst 2019). segmentr is a package that implements a handful of algorithms to segment a given data set, by finding the change points that minimize the total cost of the segments according to an arbitrary cost function. So, the user of this package has to find an adequate cost for the segmentation problem to be solved, possibly having to penalize it to avoid either an over parametrized or under parameterized model, i.e. one with too many or too few change points, respectively. Also, it’s important to consider the computation time of each algorithm and its trade-offs. This example walks through the main concepts regarding its usage, using historical temperature data from Berlin as an example. 5.1 Understanding the data The berlin data set, provided in this package, contains daily temperature measurements from 7 weather stations in Berlin for every day in the years 2010 and 2011, i.e., a total of 730 days. Therefore, every element in the data set has a temperature data point with units in Celsius, such that each of the 730 columns corresponds to a date, and each of the 7 rows corresponds to the weather station the data point was measured at. In Table 5.1, it’s possible to see the first three columns, as well as the last three columns, together with the respective stations. Table 5.1: First and last columns of the berlin dataset station 2010-01-01 2010-01-02 2010-01-03 .. 2011-12-29 2011-12-30 2011-12-31 Berlin-Buch -1.6 -1.9 -4.8 .. 6.0 3.5 2.1 Berlin-Dahlem (FU) -1.9 -2.3 -4.5 .. 5.2 3.1 2.4 Berlin-Kaniswall -1.9 -2.0 -4.6 .. 5.2 3.3 1.9 Berlin-Marzahn -1.8 -1.9 -4.8 .. 5.7 3.7 2.6 Berlin-Schoenefeld -1.9 -2.1 -4.6 .. 5.0 3.3 2.4 Berlin-Tegel -1.5 -2.0 -4.5 .. 6.0 3.5 2.8 Berlin-Tempelhof -1.4 -1.7 -4.3 .. 5.7 3.7 3.0 To grasp the behavior of the weather data, in Figure 5.1 the daily average temperature of all the weather stations, i.e., the mean value of each column in the data set as a time series graph to observe how the average temperature of Berlin behaves over time. Figure 5.1: Average daily temperature over time as measured by different stations in Berlin In the graph, the daily temperatures points alternate in upwards and downwards trends, which suggests it’s possible to fit linear regressions for each of the upwards or downwards trend segments. So, a cost that optimizes for linear regressions function is proposed, which should minimize when a linear regression fits in a given segment. By intuition, we expect the cost function to segment the dataset approximately to the way the vertical lines are placed in Figure 5.2. The indices picked to represent each segment are available in Table 5.2. Figure 5.2: Manual segmentation of the weather data picked according to intuition Table 5.2: Expected values to be found when segmenting the Berlin dataset Segment no. First index Last index 1 1 199 2 360 569 3 570 730 5.2 Building the cost function An adequate cost function should be able to rank a given set of possible segments and pick the best one given the evaluation criteria. Since the goal is to select segments with a good linear regression fit, the standard log-likelihood function for linear regressions is the the negative of the squared sum of residuals, the squared sum of residuals is a good candidate for our segment cost function. So, the cost function \\(K\\) is shown in (5.1), with the set of points \\(X\\) that belong to the segment, \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) as the points that belong to \\(X\\) for each index \\(i\\), and \\(f\\) is the best linear regression that fitted the \\(X\\) segment. \\[\\begin{equation} K(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{1}{n}(y_i - f(x_i))^2 \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] A cost argument for a segment() call requires a function which accepts a candidate segment matrix, i.e. a subset of the columns in the data set, and returns the cost for the given segment. Therefore, equation (5.1) is implemented as an R function called residual_cost, such that it obeys the argument contract by taking a matrix as argument and returning the mean of the squared residuals of a linear regression over the candidate segment. To get a sense of how the function behaves with the berlin data set, sample costs for a small, a medium, and a large segment are provided in 5.3. Table 5.3: Sample values of the squared residual cost function for different sizes of segment candidates Small Size Medium Size Large Size 0.0283673 12.18277 68.85185 With the cost function defined, it can now be applied to segment() to get the segments for the data set. Since the time complexity of the exact algorithm is \\(O(n^2)\\) and the number of points in the data set is high, the execution time required for the computation is quite prohibitive. So, for demonstration purposes, we use the hierarchical algorithm, due to its \\(O(n \\log(n))\\) complexity. We point the hierarchical algorithm (generally suitable for the cost function based on multivariate likelihood) assumes the segments to be structured hierarchically, with a combination of two neighboring segments being selected as an intermediate step before evaluating the ideal change points of the data set. The segmentation results can be seen in Table 5.4, and they are also plotted together with the weather data in Figure 5.3. Table 5.4: Results of the segmentation algorithm using a non-penalized cost function Segment no. First index Last index 1 1 2 2 3 6 3 7 17 4 18 19 5 20 21 6 22 23 7 24 24 8 25 26 9 27 28 10 29 29 11 30 31 12 32 33 13 34 35 14 36 37 15 38 38 16 39 41 17 42 43 18 44 47 19 48 730 Figure 5.3: Berlin weather data segmented using a non-penalized cost function In Figure 5.3, it’s possible to see many very short segments, and a very large last segment. This is a result of the algorithm used, as well as the fact the residual_cost function tends to favor very short segments, as they usually have smaller residual error. So, to not get segments too short or too long, it’s necessary to penalize the cost function for either extremely short or extremely long lengths. 5.3 Penalizing the cost function To penalize a cost function in the segmentr context is to increase the return value of the cost function whenever unwanted segments are provided as an input. Typically, this involves penalizing the cost function whenever a very short or a very long segment is provided. One such method is to add the output of the cost function with a penalty function which is a function of the length of the segment. We propose a penalty function in (5.2). \\[\\begin{equation} p(l) = C_1e^{s_1(l - \\frac{L}{2})} + C_2e^{s_2(-l + \\frac{L}{2})} \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] In equation (5.2), the penalty \\(p(l)\\) is a function of the segment’s length \\(l\\) and, for parametrization values \\(C_1 &gt; 0\\), \\(s_1 &gt; 0\\), \\(C_2 &gt; 0\\) and \\(s_2 &gt; 0\\), the penalty is high for values of \\(l\\) neighboring \\(0\\), as well as values of \\(l\\) in the order of the total length \\(L\\) of the data set. However, penalty is close to its minimum for values of \\(l\\) neighboring \\(\\frac{L}{2}\\). To visualize, consider a sample penalty function, with \\(C_1 = C_2 = 1\\), \\(s_1 = s_2 = 0.3\\) and \\(L = 100\\), plotted in Figure 5.4. Figure 5.4: Example curve of the penalty function for \\(C_1 = C_2 = 1\\), \\(s_1 = s_2 = 0.3\\) and \\(L = 100\\) Given the penalty function general formula, it’s necessary to adjust the parameters such the penalty function has a scale compatible with the cost function. The auto_penalize() function, provided in the segmentr package, builds a penalized version of the cost function, by estimating parametrization values based on sample cost values for big and small segments of the data set provided. The estimated parameters are tunable by adjusting the small_segment_penalty and the big_segment_penalty parameters, depending on how much small or big segments, respectively, should be penalized, i.e. the higher the parameter, the more penalized the related type of segment size is. Let \\(P_s\\) be the small_segment_penalty, \\(P_b\\) be the big_segment_penalty, \\(\\mu_s\\) be the average cost for the sampled small segments and \\(\\mu_b\\) be the average cost for the sample’s big segments. The relationship between the parameters, as defined by the auto_penalize() function, is defined in (5.3). \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} C_1 &amp; = \\frac{\\mu_b}{P_b} \\\\ s_1 &amp; = \\frac{4 \\log(P_b)}{L} \\\\ C_2 &amp; = \\frac{\\mu_s}{P_s} \\\\ s_2 &amp; = \\frac{4 \\log(P_s)}{L} \\end{aligned} \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] So, a penalized cost version of the function is created with auto_penalize() and then used with segment(). The results of the segmentation can be seen in Table 5.5, and it’s possible to the segments with the weather data in Figure 5.5. Table 5.5: Results of the segmentation algorithm using an auto-penalized cost function Segment no. First index Last index 1 1 2 2 3 6 3 7 17 4 18 19 5 20 21 6 22 23 7 24 24 8 25 26 9 27 28 10 29 29 11 30 31 12 32 33 13 34 35 14 36 37 15 38 38 16 39 41 17 42 43 18 44 47 19 48 730 Figure 5.5: Berlin weather data segmented using an auto-penalized cost function We now get a reduced number of segments estimated by the new penalized cost function in Figure 5.5 found by the new penalized cost, though it’s also over segmenting some downward trends. It suggests the big_segment_penalty argument needs to be decreased to allow for larger segments to be estimated by the solution. So, by decreasing it’s value, from the default of \\(10\\), down to \\(2\\), we run the results again with the segment() function. The results can be seen in 5.6, and it’s possible for the segments with the weather data in Figure 5.6. Table 5.6: Results of the segmentation algorithm using an adjusted penalized cost function Segment no. First index Last index 1 1 237 2 238 453 3 454 730 Figure 5.6: Berlin weather data segmented using an adjusted penalized cost function Though we got a reduced number of segments in the new adjusted penalized_cost, the segments seen in Figure 5.6 still aren’t similar to what we are looking for as shown in Figure 5.2. The reason behind this, as discussed earlier, is due to the incorrect assumption the data is hierarchical. So, to segment the data ideally, it’s necessary to evaluate all of the possibilities. The exact algorithm does precisely compute all of the possibilities, but its \\(O(n^2)\\) time complexity is quite prohibitive to run the computation on the entire data set. So we can make the computation tolerable by reducing the granularity of the data, getting the monthly averages for each of the measurement stations. 5.4 Reducing granularity The data set needs to be resampled to represent the monthly weather averages. It is done by computing the average temperature for each combination of month and weather station. With the granularity reduction, the data set will have 24 columns, one for each month in the two years comprehended. The plot of the monthly average temperature of the temperatures of all the data points is plotted in figure 5.7 Figure 5.7: Average monthly temperature over time as measured by different stations in Berlin A new penalized_cost function is then built and applied to the monthly data set using segment(), with the results being shown in Table 5.7, and with we also plot it with weather data in Figure 5.8. Table 5.7: Results of the segmentation algorithm using an auto-penalized cost function over downsampled berlin data Segment no. First index Last index 1 1 6 2 7 11 3 12 18 4 19 24 Figure 5.8: Downsampled Berlin monthly weather data segmented using an auto penalized cost function To make the solution comparison clearer, it’s possible to rescale the exact solution to the monthly sampled dataset to the daily sampled dataset by applying a linear transformation of multiplying all the change points for the number of columns in the daily dataset and dividing it by the number of columns in the monthly dataset, i.e. each rescaled change point \\(C_i\\) relates to the original change point \\(c_i\\) as described in equation (5.4), in which \\(i\\) is the index of each change point estimated with the monthly data set, \\(N_M\\) represents the number of columns in the monthly Berlin weather data set and \\(N_B\\) represents the number of columns in the daily Berlin data set, in the original form provided by the segmentr package. \\[\\begin{equation} C_i = \\left \\lfloor{c_i \\frac{N_B}{N_M}} \\right \\rfloor \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] After applying that transformation, the results can be seen in Table 5.8, as well as the plot along with the daily graph in Figure 5.9 Table 5.8: Results of the segmentation algorithm using an auto-penalized cost function over downsampled berlin data, but rescaled to fit the original data dimensions Segment no.

Table 5.2 lists the considered solution considered ideal to the problem, at the same time as different solutions were found in Tables 5.4, 5.5 and 5.7. Considering this, the Hausdorff distance can be used to measure how far each estimate is from the ideal solution described in Table 5.2. In Table 5.9 we can see the results of the comparison, in which we can see the distance of each estimate calculated. Table 5.9: Hausdorff distance for different segmentation attepmts over the Berlin weather data set Results referenced Estimated Changepoints Hausdorff Distance to Ideal Table 5.2 200, 360, 570 0 Table 5.4 3, 7, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 39, 42, 44, 48 522 Table 5.5 3, 7, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 39, 42, 44, 48 522 Table 5.6 238, 454 116 Table 5.8 213, 365, 578 13 In Table 5.9 we can see the distance to the ideal is gradually decreased more adequate parameters are used to compute the segment estimates for the segmentation estimate. This improvement reflects the progress that can be observed in gradually in Figures 5.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.9. 5.6 A non-usual cost function Notice the only requirement on the cost function is for it to be able to rank segments in a desired manner. Therefore, there’s freedom to pick a non-conventional cost function. For example, the R-squared statistic of the linear regression in each segment is conventionally used to infer how well the linear model fits the points in the data. It ranges from zero to one and the closer it is to one, the better it predicts the points in the data. Therefore, we propose the implementation of a rsquared_cost, which fits a linear regression against the data set received as input in the function and then returns the opposite R-squared statistic as the “cost” value of the segment. The defined function is applied against different segment sizes of the berlin data set, analogous to Table 5.3, and the results are shown in 5.10. Table 5.10: Sample values of the R-squared cost function for different sizes of segment candidates Small Size Medium Size Large Size -0.982116 -0.7601494 -0.0328304 From what is observed in Table 5.10, and similar to the previous case, the new rsquared_cost has the lowest values for small segments. Therefore, it needs to be penalized with the auto_penalize function. We then go on and apply the results of the penalized function and show them in Table 5.11. The plot with the weather data can be seen in Figure 5.10. Table 5.11: Results of the segmentation algorithm using an auto-penalized R-squared cost function over Berlin data Segment no. First index Last index 1 1 268 2 269 550 3 551 730 Figure 5.10: Berlin daily weather data segmented using an auto-penalized R-squared cost function The default penalized rsquared_cost split the data set in three segments, roughly the same size each. It makes sense because the penalty applied by the default auto_penalize funtion has the lowest penalty for segments of sizes closer to about half the total length. So, increasing the big_penalty_segment argument will not affect solution estimation anymore. In contrast, smaller segments are being over penalized. Because of this, it’s necessary to reduce the small_segment_penalty segment, which we decrease to \\(1.5\\), from the default of \\(10\\). The results of the new segmentation can be seen in Table 5.12, and the plot in Figure 5.11. Table 5.12: Results of the segmentation algorithm using an adjusted penalized R-squared cost function over Berlin data Segment no. First index Last index 1 1 237 2 238 364 3 365 366 4 367 587 5 588 724 6 725 730 Figure 5.11: Berlin daily weather data segmented using an adjusted penalized R-squared cost function With the adjusted parameters, we see the rsquared_penalized was able to segment the data in Figure 5.11 in a seemingly accurate manner, despite the nature of the hierarchical algorithm. As discussed previously, we point the hierarchical algorithm is not adequate for the squared residual cost, as the grouping of neighboring segments under a macro-segment, an intermediate segment state under the hierarchical algorithm, has an unattractive cost value, due to the presence of alternating trends. Because of this, the macro-segment is never picked by the algorithm during the computation process, and so the ideal change points are never picked at their ideal positions. To see it more clearly, take the first 547 data points of the Berlin data set, roughly one year and a half. The results of the segmentation with that portion of the berlin data set can be seen in Table 5.13, and the plot can be seen in Figure 5.12.

["considerations-on-performance.html", "6 Considerations on performance 6.1 Benchmark the code 6.2 Native Code 6.3 Parallelization", " 6 Considerations on performance This code shows a handful of attempts that were made in actually trying to execution time of the algorithms implemented by the package. 6.1 Benchmark the code The package microbenchmark allows us to execute the code and compare different run-times. Therefore it’s going to be used in this package to compare the performance of different code snippets. 6.2 Native Code In the algorithms chapter, we discussed the time complexity of the different types of algorithms. In that scenario, the most relevant variable is the number of columns in the data set, which dictates whether the computation of the exact algorithm will be prohibitive or not. However, the number of samples does influence the computation time linearly. Given the most performed operation in any of the algorithms described in the chapter is the cost function, it’s, in essence, the bottleneck of the whole computation. Therefore, real performance gains can be obtained depending on the performance of the application. In R statistical programming, it’s commonplace to use the functions provided by the programming environment, which are usually performant algorithms implemented in compiled programming languages such as C. However, there are times the programmer must implement a custom function in R, which in turn is a dynamically, and typically slower execution environment. Therefore, in a first attempt to make the code execution run faster, and compare different results, segmentr implements the [multivariate()] likelihood function (used to calculate the cost) in compiled C++ programming language, as well as it implements [r_multivariate()] which implements the same algorithm in the R programming environment. Table 6.1: Execution time comparison between native C++ and interpreted R code expr time (ms) segment(data, cost = function(x) -r_multivariate(x), algorithm = “hierarchical”) 104.103 segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “hierarchical”) 31.353 segment(data, cost = function(x) -r_multivariate(x), algorithm = “exact”) 58629.763 segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “exact”) 8919.367 In the scenario above, we notice performance improvements in the native [multivariate()] function, with the biggest performance improvement taking place in the exact algorithm results. Therefore, whenever the resources are available, it’s recommended to implement the cost function (or portions of it) directly in a native programming language such as C++. We recommend the RCpp package, which makes it easy to implement functions that interface easily with the R programming environment. 6.3 Parallelization Given the increasing trend of parallel programming in the past few years, it’s natural to try to take advantage of that by parallelizing the algorithm execution. In the algorithms implemented in this paper, parallelization is a bit complicated because a lot of the execution steps in the algorithm iterations depend on values computed in previous steps, and the golden rule of parallel computing is that faster results are generally obtained when computation steps are independent from one another, i.e. no dependency between the task, hence they can be performed in parallel. Yet, there are a few steps of the computation that can be performed in parallel, and its parallelization was implemented with the help of the foreach package. Therefore, whether or not the computation will be performed depends on whether there is a parallel cluster registered in the R session with packages such as doMC, and whether the allow_parallel argument is true or false. With that in mind, a few comparisons are evaluated. Table 6.2: Execution time comparison between parallel and single-threaded computation with a data set of 100 samples and 10 columns expr time (ms) segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “hierarchical”, allow_parallel = TRUE) 38.638 segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “exact”, allow_parallel = TRUE) 287.124 segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “exact”, allow_parallel = FALSE) 155.071 segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “hierarchical”, allow_parallel = FALSE) 19.471 Analyzing the results above, we notice good improvements, especially for the “exact” algorithm. However, in a situation in which the number of rows isn’t very large in comparison with the number of columns, the results of the parallel computation are a lot more modest. Consider the following case. Table 6.3: Execution time comparison between parallel and single-threaded computation with a data set of 5 samples and 100 columns expr time (ms) segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “hierarchical”, allow_parallel = FALSE) 45.443 segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “exact”, allow_parallel = TRUE) 6962.734 segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “exact”, allow_parallel = FALSE) 6337.147 segment(data, cost = function(x) -multivariate(x), algorithm = “hierarchical”, allow_parallel = TRUE) 44.920 In the result above, parallelization achieved the opposite effect, actually making the computation slower, as there is now a lot of work done synchronizing necessary information between all the processes in the cluster. That takes more time than is saved by running the algorithm in parallel. Taking all of that into consideration, the decision of whether or not to use parallelization relies on the user after evaluating the nature of the data set. For data sets with few samples and many columns, parallelization is not recommended. In the case there are lots of samples, parallelization might give better computation times. An alternative not developed in this project would be to use a genetic algorithm approach to the optimal set estimation, which is a probabilistic process that converges to the result after enough computation time has passed. The main advantage of such a method is that computations can be more easily parallelized. Such development might be explored in future developments in this package. "],
["conclusion.html", "7 Conclusion", " 7 Conclusion This work describes the segmentation problem, provides a theoretical model to work with the segmentation of data, and goes on to describe a few algorithms to try to estimate the set of points that optimally segment a given data set, explaining the differences between them. Then we proceed and describe the actually implementation of such algorithms in an actual R package, in an attempt to make its use easier for researchers. We provide a few applications with simulated data, and also provide a real analysis with a real weather data set. Finally, performance considerations are taken into consideration when trying to have the code run faster. In summary, there are a lot of decisions involved in the problem of segmentation, such as picking the right cost function for the evaluation, which algorithm to pick, and whether or not parallelization can help in running the computation faster. By providing a common set of tools, we hope to make the life of the researcher easier. "],
