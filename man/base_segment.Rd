\title{Base arguments for segment function}
\usage{
base_segment(data, likelihood, penalty, max_segments, allow_parallel)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix for which to find the changepooints}

\item{likelihood}{a function receives the segment matrix as argument
and returns a likelihood estimation. This function is used to calculate the
changepoints that maximize the total likelihood. Depending on the algorithm
being used, this function is likely to be executed many times, in which
case it's also likely to be the bottleneck of the function execution, so
it's advised that this function should have a performant, native
implementation. Defaults to a performant \code{multivariate} estimation.}

\item{max_segments}{an integer that defines the maximum amount of segments to
split the data into.}

\item{allow_parallel}{allows parallel execution to take place using the
registered cluster. Assumes a cluster is registered with the \code{foreach}
package. Defaults to TRUE.}
