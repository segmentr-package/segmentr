\title{Logarithmic Discrete Multivariate Likelihood estimation function implemented
efficiently}
\usage{
multivariate(data, na_action = na.omit)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Matrix to estimate the multivariate of. Each row is considered to
be an observation, and each column is considered to be a different
variable.}

\item{na_action}{A function that is applied to the \code{X} parameter. Defaults to
\code{na.omit} function.}
}
\value{
the estimate of the Discrite Maximum Likelyhood for the dataframe
provided.
}
\description{
Calculates the discrete log likelihood multivariate estimation of a data
matrix using an algorithm implemented in C++ for performance. This is
intented to be used in conjunction with \code{\link{segment}} and
\code{\link{hieralg}}, as the log likelihood function is executed multiple
times, which makes it the bottleneck of the computation. Because the
multivariate is so commonly used, this efficient implementation is provided.
