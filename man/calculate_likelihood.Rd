\title{Calculate a dataset's likelihood using changepoints of \code{segmentr} object}
\usage{
calculate_likelihood(results, newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{a segmentr object, which contains the definition of the changepoints to be applied}

\item{newdata}{a dataset for which we wish to calculate the total likelihood}
}
\description{
Given the changepoints in a segmentr object, this function splits a
new dataset into segments and then calculates the total likelihood
using the likelihood function of the \code{segmentr} object.
}
\details{
This function splits a \code{newdata} dataset into segments according to the
changepoints in the \code{results} segmentr object. It then uses the \code{likelihood}
function of the segmentr object to calculate the total likelihood of the new object.
