[@fpop] also talks about optimally segmenting a data set, given a *cost*
function to be minimized for the segments the data set is going to be split
into. That is analogous to the segment *likelihood*, with the case in point
that we look forward to maximize the likelihood function in this paper.

In their paper, they discuss different search algorithms for searching
the change points in the data set, focusing on pruning the search path given
the cost function satisfies certain conditions that allows for the result
of the pruned search be mathematically optimal. More noticeably, they proposed
`fpop` and `snip` as prune-based search algorithm which they claim provide
better results compared to those they draw inspirations from.

Given the implementation of the Segmentr package is generic enough, in the
sense that it allows for the user to change the search algorithm with minimal
code modification, it's possible for those algorithms to be implemented in
the package.
