# Solution Search Algorithms

The algorithm described in \@ref(model-selection-criterion) gives us the exact
answer to the dataset provided. The complexity of the algithm, however, is
$O(n^2)$, which means the execution time will be prohibitive for very large
datasets.

Taking that into consideration, two different algorithms are proposed in order
to resuce the complexity of the algorithm.

## Hierarchical algorithm

The `hierarchical algorithm` assumes the changepoints have a hierarchical structure.
The way it works is the algorithm goes throgh the data once, identify a point that
maximizes the likelihood function, and then recursively calls the function on the
segments divided by the newly found changepoint.

## Hybrid algorithm

The `hybrid algorithm` uses a mixed approach, in which it used the hierarchical
approach for when the segments are larger than a specified `threshold`, and uses
the exact approach for when the segments are smaller than the threshold.
