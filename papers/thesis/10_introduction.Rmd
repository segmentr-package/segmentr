# Introduction

[@base-paper] describe a method of segmenting a data set of a finite alphabet
into blocks of independent variables. This work expands on that by minimizing a
cost function rather than maximizing a likelihood function, such the cost is
the opposite of the likelihood. We show this generalization can be used for
other use-cases, e.g. segments with homogeneous values (see Chapter
\@ref(segments-with-similar-averages)), segments that have the same linear
regression trend \@ref(real-data-examples).

This work was developed as an R Programming Language [@R-lang] package. The
packaging of the code into redistributable software was based on instructions
provided by [@r-package-tutorial], and the final code is made available as an R
package [@segmentr-cran]. The goal was to make it as easy as
possible for researchers and R programmers to use this software. The source code
for the package is also available as an open-source software @segmentr-github.
Finally, as a special implementation for the use case described by
[@base-paper] of segmenting finite alphabets, a specialized version of the
multivariate likelihood function is implemented in native code using Rcpp
[@rcpp].


## Related Work

[@fpop] also talks about optimally segmenting a data set with the minimization
of a given cost function. In their paper, they discuss search path algorithms
different than the ones shown in this work. In their case, if the cost function
satisfies certain conditions, the `fpop` and `snip` search algorithms can prune
the search path in a mathematically optimal way. They claim the algorithms
presented in their work provide better results than previous work.

Notice that, because the approach used by [@fpop] is different than the one
used by [@base-paper], the `fpop` and `snip` algorithms couldn't be
investigated and validated in time to be implemented in the Segmentr package.
However, if in future work those algorithms provide good results estimation
and performance compared to the currently implemented algorithms, they can be
included in the Segmentr package. That will allow users to use the newly
implemented algorithms with minimal code modification, by changing a single
parameter.
