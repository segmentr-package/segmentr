# Introduction

[@base-paper] describe a method of sequence segmentation by analyzing a given
sequence data set using a multivariate likelihood function. This work extends
on that by generalizing the type of likelihood function, such that it can be
used for use-cases other than maximizing the likelihood of correlated segments,
e.g. segments with homogeneous values (see Chapter \@ref(segments-with-similar-averages)), segments that have the same linear
regression trend \@ref(real-data-examples).

This work is demonstrated in the R Programming Language [@R-lang] environment
and, based on the instructions provided by [@r-package-tutorial], this work is
made available as an R package @segmentr-cran, with the goal of being easily
usable by researchers and R programmers. Source code for the package is also
available as an open source software @segmentr-github. Also, for the use case
described by [@base-paper], a performant version of the multivariate likelihood
function is implemented using RCPP [@rcpp].
