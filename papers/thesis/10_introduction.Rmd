# Introduction

[@base-paper] describe a method of sequence segmentation by analyzing a given
sequence data set using a multivariate likelihood function. This work extends
on that by generalizing the type of likelihood function, such that it can be
used for use-cases other than maximizing the likelihood of correlated segments,
e.g. segments with homogeneous values (see Chapter \@ref(segments-with-similar-averages)), segments that have the same linear
regression trend \@ref(real-data-examples).

This work is demonstrated in the R Programming Language [@R-lang] environment
and, based on the instructions provided by [@r-package-tutorial], this work is
made available as an R package @segmentr-cran, with the goal of being easily
usable by researchers and R programmers. Source code for the package is also
available as an open source software @segmentr-github. Also, for the use case
described by [@base-paper], a performant version of the multivariate likelihood
function is implemented using RCPP [@rcpp].


## Related Work

[@fpop] also talks about optimally segmenting a data set, given a *cost*
function to be minimized for the segments the data set is going to be split
into. That is analogous to the segment *likelihood*, with the case in point
that we look forward to maximize the likelihood function in this paper.

In their paper, they discuss different search algorithms for searching
the change points in the data set, focusing on pruning the search path given
the cost function satisfies certain conditions that allows for the result
of the pruned search be mathematically optimal. More noticeably, they proposed
`fpop` and `snip` as prune-based search algorithm which they claim provide
better results compared to those they draw inspirations from.

Given the implementation of the Segmentr package is generic enough, in the
sense that it allows for the user to change the search algorithm with minimal
code modification, it's possible for those algorithms to be implemented in
the package.
