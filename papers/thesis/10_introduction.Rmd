# Introduction

[@base-paper] describes a method of segmenting a data set of a finite alphabet
into blocks of independent variables. This work expands on that by minimizing a
cost function rather than maximizing a likelihood function, the two being equivalend
when the cost function output is the opposite of the likelihood function output.
We show this generalization can be used for
other use-cases, e.g. segments with homogeneous values (see Chapter
\@ref(segments-with-similar-averages)), segments that have the same linear
regression trend (see Chapter )\@ref(real-data-examples)).

This work produced an R Programming Language [@R-lang] package. The
packaging of the code into redistributable software was based on instructions
provided by [@r-package-tutorial], and can be installed through CRAN
[@segmentr-cran], with the goal of making it as easy as
possible for researchers and R programmers to use this software. All the source code
is open-source and available on GitHub [@segmentr-github].
Finally, a specialized version of the multivariate likelihood function is
implemented in native code using the `Rcpp` package [@rcpp], which allows a faster execution
for the use-case described in [@base-paper].


## Related Work

[@fpop] also talks about optimally segmenting a data set with the minimization
of a given cost function. In their paper, they discuss search path algorithms
different than the ones shown in this work. In their case, if the cost function
satisfies certain conditions, the `fpop` and `snip` search algorithms can prune
the search path in a mathematically optimal way. They claim the algorithms
presented in their work provide better results than previous work.

Notice that, because the approach used by [@fpop] is different than the one
used by [@base-paper], the `fpop` and `snip` algorithms couldn't be
investigated and validated in time to be implemented in the `segmentr` package.
However, if in future work those algorithms provide good results estimation
and performance compared to the current algorithms, they can be
included in the `segmentr` package. That will allow users to use the newly
implemented algorithms with minimal code modification, by changing a single
parameter.
