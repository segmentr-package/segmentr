# Introduction

[@base-paper] describe a method of segmenting a data set of a finite alphabet
into blocks of independent variables. This work expands on that by generalizing
the likelihood function used in the solution, showing it can be used for other
use-cases, e.g. segments with homogeneous values (see Chapter
\@ref(segments-with-similar-averages)), segments that have the same linear
regression trend \@ref(real-data-examples).

This work was developed as an R Programming Language [@R-lang] package. The
packaging of the code into redistributable software was based on instructions
provided by [@r-package-tutorial], and the final code is made available as an R
package [@segmentr-cran]. The goal was to make it as easy as
possible for researchers and R programmers to use this software. The source code
for the package is also available as an open-source software @segmentr-github.
Finally, as a special implementation for the use case described by
[@base-paper] of segmenting finite alphabets, a specialized version of the
multivariate likelihood function is implemented in native code using Rcpp
[@rcpp].


## Related Work

[@fpop] also talks about optimally segmenting a data set, given a *cost*
function to be minimized for the segments the data set is going to be split
into. That is analogous to the segment likelihood used in this work, with the
difference that we look forward to maximizing the likelihood function in
this paper rather than minimizing it.

In their paper, they discuss search path algorithms different than the ones
shown in this work. In their case, if the cost function satisfies certain
conditions, the `fpop` and `snip` search algorithms can prune the search path in a mathematically optimal way. They claim the algorithms presented in
their work provide better results than previous work.

Notice that, because the approach used by [@fpop] is different than the one
used by [@base-paper], the `fpop` and `snip` algorithms couldn't be
investigated and validated in time to be implemented in the Segmentr package.
However, if in future works those algorithms provide good results estimation
and performance compared to the currently implemented algorithms, they can be
included in the Segmentr package. That will allow users to use the newly
implemented algorithms with minimal code modification, by changing a single
parameter.
