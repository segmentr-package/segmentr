# Conclusion

This work describes the segmentation problem, provides a theoretical model to work
with the segmentation of data, and goes on to describe a few algorithms to try to
estimate the set of points that optimally segment a given data set, explaining
the differences between them.

Then we proceed and describe the actual implementation of such algorithms
in an actual R package, in an attempt to make its use easier for researchers.
We provide a few applications with simulated data, and also provide a real analysis
with a real weather data set. Finally, performance considerations are taken into
consideration when trying to have the code run faster.

In summary, there are a lot of decisions involved in the problem of segmentation,
such as picking the right cost function for the evaluation, which
algorithm to pick, and whether or not parallelization can help in running the computation
faster. By providing a common set of tools, we hope to make the life of the researcher
easier.
