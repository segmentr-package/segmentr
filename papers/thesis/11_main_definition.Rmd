# Main Definition

In this chapter we explain the problem by providing definitions of concepts and
build equations that gradually help us explain the problem and make the case
for our solution.

## A sequence of random variables and its segments

Let $X$ be a vector of random variables defined in
\@ref(eq:definerandomvector), in which each $X_j$ belong a set $S$. The
equation also shows all random variables $X_j$ have probability distribution
$F$, each with parameter $\Theta_j$, such that $X_j \sim F(\Theta_j)$. A
segment is defined as a sequence of indices such that $\Theta_a = \Theta_{a+1}
= \dots = \Theta_b$ such that $1 \le a \le b \le m$, in each $a$ and $b$
represent the first and last index of the segment, respectively. We also define
a change point $c$ as being an index in which there is a change in the
probability distribution parameters, i.e. $\Theta_{c-1} \ne \Theta_c$, for $c
\ge 2$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
X= (X_1, \dots , X_m) \\
X_j\in S, \text{ for } 1 \le j \le m \text{ and } j \in \Z \\
X_j\sim F(\Theta_j)
\end{gathered}
(\#eq:definerandomvector)
\end{equation}

Putting it all together in \@ref(eq:definesegments), a data set $X$ with $t$
change points has each segment represented by the sequence $S_k = X_{c_k},
\dots, X_{c_{k+1}-1}$, with $c_k$ each representing a change point. In order to
simplify equations, let $c_0 = 1$ and $c_{t+1} = m + 1$, even though they are
not change points.


\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
c_0 = 1\\
c_{t+1} = m + 1 \\
1 \lt c_{1} \lt \dots \lt c_k \lt \dots \lt c_t \lt m + 1 \\, \text{ for } 0 \le k \le t \text{ and } k \in \Z \\
\Theta_{c_k} = \Theta_{c_k+1} = \dots = \Theta_{c_{k+1}-1} \\
\Theta_{c_k - 1} \ne \Theta_{c_k}, \text{ for } 1 \le k \le t \text{ and } k \in \Z \\
S_k = X_{c_k}, \dots, X_{c_{k+1}-1}
\end{gathered}
(\#eq:definesegments)
\end{equation}

## The segmentation problem

Let $D$ be a $n \times m$ matrix defined in \@ref(eq:definematrixd), with $n$
rows and $m$ columns. The matrix is comprised of $n$ samples of the vector of
random variables $X$, i.e. the column $j$ in the matrix has values
corresponding to the random variable $X_j$. Let $C$, defined in
\@ref(eq:definechangepointset), be the set of change points in the data set.
Since we have that all random variables within a segment have the same
probability function parameter, let $L$ be the likelihood function whose
maximizing argument, when given a segment $S_k$, is the probability
distribution parameter $\Theta_k$, as shown in
\@ref(eq:definesegmentlikelihood). Therefore, the segmentation problem is
defined as the process of estimating the set of change points $C$.

\begin{equation}
D =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{11} & \dots & x_{1j} & \dots & x_{1m} \\
    \dots  & \dots & \dots  & \dots & \dots  \\
    x_{i1} & \dots & x_{ij} & \dots & x_{im} \\
    \dots  & \dots & \dots  & \dots & \dots  \\
    x_{n1} & \dots & x_{nj} & \dots & x_{nm}
  \end{bmatrix}_{n \times m}
(\#eq:definematrixd)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
C = \{ c_1, \dots, c_t \}
(\#eq:definechangepointset)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Theta_k = arg\,max\left\{L(\Theta|S_k)\right\}
(\#eq:definesegmentlikelihood)
\end{equation}


One approach to find the change points set $C$ is to maximize a likelihood
function over the data set $D$ as shown in \@ref(eq:definemaximization).
Considering the data set is compound by all the segments, and that each
individual segment $S_k$ will maximize the likelihood $L$ for that portion of
the data set, the likelihood of change points set $C$ can be defined as the sum
of the likelihoods of all the segments as shown in
\@ref(eq:definelikelihoodsum).


Notice that, in \@ref(eq:definemaximization) and in
\@ref(eq:definelikelihoodsum), the segment likelihood function $L$ and the data
set $X$ are parameters to the segmentation problem, which will ultimately be
used to search for the set of change points $C$ using dynamic programming. So,
let $s$ be a segmentation function such that $C = s(L, X)$, as defined in
\@ref(eq:definesegmentation). Segmentr provides a few implementations of
segmentation function that can be used to solve the segmentation problem.

\begin{equation}
C = arg\,max\left\{ \lik \left(C | X = D\right)\right\}
(\#eq:definemaximization)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\lik (C) = \sum_{k=0}^t L(S_k) = \sum_{k=0}^t L(\Theta | S_k)
(\#eq:definelikelihoodsum)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C = s(L, X) = arg\,max \left\{ \sum_{k=0}^t L(\Theta | S_k) \right\}
(\#eq:definesegmentation)
\end{equation}


In summary, Segmentr is a generalization of the work described in
[@base-paper], in which the random variables of $X$ are taken from finite
alphabets and $L$ is the multivariate estimate of discrete variables. In this
work, besides analyzing the same problem described in [@base-paper], the fact
$L$ is a parameter the segmentation function means it can be applied to many
different scenarios in which $X$ can manifest itself, e.g. segments with changes
in the mean of columns, segments with different linear regression parameters.
These cases are discussed in \@ref(simulations) and \@ref(real-data-examples).

## The Hausdorff distance

As the solution estimated by the segmentation function is a set of points, a
measure is made necessary to compare the estimations provided by the different
estimation algorithms that will be presented in Chapter
\@ref(solution-estimation). The Hausdorff distance is commonly used as a
measure of distance between two distinct sets, and will be used to to compare
change point sets with differing number of elements each.

[@topology] defines the Haurdorff distance as measure of how far two subsets
from a metric space are from one another. It's defined as the biggest of all
the distances from a point in one set to the closest point in the other set,
which is expressed mathematically by the equation defined in
\@ref(eq:hausdorffformula), in which $X$ and $Y$ represent sets given as inputs
to the function, $d(x, y)$ represents a distance function defined in the metric
space $S$ such that $x, y \in S$.

\begin{equation}
d_H(X,Y) = \max\left\{\,\sup_{x \in X} \inf_{y \in Y} d(x,y)\, ,\, \sup_{y \in Y} \inf_{x \in X} d(x,y)\,\right\}
(\#eq:hausdorffformula)
\end{equation}

Since a set of change points is a subset of the column indices in a data set,
we define the distance $d$ as the absolute value of two given numbers for
the use cases analyzed in this paper.
