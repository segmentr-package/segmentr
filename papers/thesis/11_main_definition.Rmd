# Main Definition

In this chapter we explain the problem by providing definitions of concepts and
build equations that gradually help us explain the problem and make the case
for our solution.

## A sequence of random variables and its segments

Let $X$ be a vector of random variables defined in
\@ref(eq:definerandomvector), in which each $X_j$ belong a set $S$. The
equation also shows all random variables $X_j$ have probability distribution
$F$, each with parameter $\Theta_j$, such that $X_j \sim F(\Theta_j)$. A
segment is defined as a sequence of indices such that $\Theta_a = \Theta_{a+1}
= \dots = \Theta_b$ such that $1 \le a \le b \le m$, in each $a$ and $b$
represent the first and last index of the segment, respectively. We also define
a change point $c$ as being an index in which there is a change in the
probability distribution parameters, i.e. $\Theta_{c-1} \ne \Theta_c$, for $c
\ge 2$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
X= (X_1, \dots , X_m) \\
X_j\in S, \text{ for } 1 \le j \le m \text{ and } j \in \Z \\
X_j\sim F(\Theta_j)
\end{gathered}
(\#eq:definerandomvector)
\end{equation}

Putting it all together in \@ref(eq:definesegments), a data set $X$ with $t$
change points has each segment represented by the sequence $S_k = X_{c_k}, \dots,
X_{c_{k+1}-1}$, with $c_k$ each representing a change point. In order to simplify
equations, let $c_0 = 1$ and $c_{t+1} = m + 1$ even though they are not change points.


\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
c_0 = 1\\
c_{t+1} = m + 1 \\
1 \lt c_{1} \lt \dots \lt c_k \lt \dots \lt c_t \lt m + 1 \\, \text{ for } 0 \le k \le t \text{ and } k \in \Z \\
\Theta_{c_k} = \Theta_{c_k+1} = \dots = \Theta_{c_{k+1}-1} \\
\Theta_{c_k - 1} \ne \Theta_{c_k}, \text{ for } 1 \le k \le t \text{ and } k \in \Z \\
S_k = X_{c_k}, \dots, X_{c_{k+1}-1}
\end{gathered}
(\#eq:definesegments)
\end{equation}

## The segmentation problem

Let $D$ be a $n \times m$ matrix defined in \@ref(eq:definematrixd), with n
rows and m columns. The matrix is comprised of $n$ samples of the vector of
random variables $X$, i.e. the column $j$ in the matrix has values
corresponding to the random variable $X_j$. Let $C$, defined in
\@ref(eq:definechangepointset), be the set of change points in the data set.
Since we have that all random variables within a segment have the same
probability function parameter, let $L$ be the likelihood function whose
maximizing argument, when given a segment $S_k$, is the probability distribution
parameter $\Theta_k$, as shown in \@ref(eq:definesegmentlikelihood). Therefore,
the segmentation problem is defined as the process of estimating the set of
change points $C$.

\begin{equation}
D =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{11} & \dots & x_{1j} & \dots & x_{1m} \\
    \dots  & \dots & \dots  & \dots & \dots  \\
    x_{i1} & \dots & x_{ij} & \dots & x_{im} \\
    \dots  & \dots & \dots  & \dots & \dots  \\
    x_{n1} & \dots & x_{nj} & \dots & x_{nm}
  \end{bmatrix}_{n \times m}
(\#eq:definematrixd)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
C = \{ c_1, \dots, c_t \}
(\#eq:definechangepointset)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Theta_k = arg\,min\left\{L(\Theta|S_k)\right\}
(\#eq:definesegmentlikelihood)
\end{equation}


One approach to find the change points set $C$ is to maximize a likelihood
function over the data set $D$ as shown in \@ref(eq:definemaximization).
Considering the data set is compound by all the segments, and that each
individual segment $S_k$ will maximize the likelihood $L$ for that portion of
the data set, the likelihood of change points set $C$ can be defined as the sum of the
likelihoods of all the segments as shown in \@ref(eq:definelikelihoodsum).


Notice that, in \@ref(eq:definemaximization) and in
\@ref(eq:definelikelihoodsum), the segment likelihood function $L$ and the data
set $X$ are parameters to the segmentation problem, which will ultimately be
used to search for the set of change points $C$ using dynamic programming.
So, let $s$ be a segmentation function such that $C = s(L, X)$. Segmentr
provides a few implementations of segmentation function that can be used to
solve the segmentation problem.

\begin{equation}
C = arg\,max\left\{ \lik \left(C | X = D\right)\right\}
(\#eq:definemaximization)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\lik (C) = \sum_{k=0}^t L(S_k) = \sum_{k=0}^t L(F(\Theta_{c_k} | S_k))
(\#eq:definelikelihoodsum)
\end{equation}

In summary, Segmentr is a generalization of the work described in [@base-paper],
in which the random variables of $X$ have values taken from finite alphabets
and $L$ is the multivariate estimate of discrete variables. Even though an
efficient version of the multivariate function is provided in Segmentr, the
fact $L$ is an input to the function means it can be applied to many different
scenarios in which $X$ can manifest itself, e.g. correlation of segments
in genetic data, runs of homozygosis in genetic data or even upwards or downwards
trends in weather data, all of which have examples shown in this paper.
