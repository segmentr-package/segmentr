# Main Definition

In this chapter we explain the problem by providing definitions of consepts
and build equations that gradually help us explain the problem and make the
case for our solution.

## A sequence of random variables and its segments

Let $X = (X_1, \dots , X_m)$ be a vector of random variables whose values are
taken on a set of interest $S$, representing the problem to be analyzed. Let
each random variable $X_j$, with $1 \le j \le m$, has its own probability
distribution. We say an index $2 \le c_k \le m$ is a *change point* if the
random variables $X_1, \dots, X_{c_k - 1}$ are independent from random
variables $X_{c_k}, \dots, X_m$, with $c_k \in C$ and $C = \{c_1, \dots, c_t\}$
representing the set of a total of $t$ change points that can exist in $X$.

For the sake of simplicity, let $c_0 = 1$ and $c_{t+1} = m + 1$. Then, we
define a segment as being the sequence of random variables $S_k = X_{c_k},
\dots, X_{c_{k+1}-1}$, with $0 \le k \le m$. Also, because the random variables
in each segment are independent from the ones in the other segments, we say the
segments are independent from each other.

## The segmentation problem

Let $D$ be a $n \times m$ matrix with n rows and m columns, in which each
column $D_j$, with $1 \le j \le m$, is a vector of observations of the
random variable $X_j$, i.e. $D$ is a set of $n$ observations of the
random variables vector $X$, with each row representing a different
observation.

Given $D$ as being known, the segmentation problem is defined as estimating the
set of change points $C$ which maximize the total likelihood of all segments in
the problem. In other words, $C = arg\,max\left\{\mathcal{L}(C|X=D)\right\}$,
in which the argument is the value each ${c_1,\dots\, c_t}$ and $L$ is the
likelihood function of the entire data set. Since the segments are independent
from each other, then $\mathcal{L}(C) = \sum_{k=1}^t L(S_k)$, in which $L(S_k)$
represents the likelihood of the segment $L(S_k)$. Notice the segment
likelihood function $L$ is left as an input variable to the segmentation
problem, which ultimately the set of change points $C$ is a function os $L$ and
the data set that represents $X$, i.e. $C = s(L, X)$, in which $s(L, X)$ is a
segmentation function and Segmentr provides a few implementations of
segmentation function.

Notice that Segmentr is a generalization of the work described in [@base-paper],
in which the random variables of $X$ have values taken from finite alphabets
and $L$ is the multivariate estimate of discrete variables. Even though an
efficient version of the multivariate function is provided in Segmentr, the
fact $L$ is an input to the function means it can be applied to many different
scenarios in which $X$ can manifest itself, e.g. correlation of segments
in genetic data, runs of homozygosis in genetic data or even upwards or downwards
trends in weather data, all of which have examples shown in this paper.
