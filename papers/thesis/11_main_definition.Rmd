# Main Definition

Consider a matrix ${\X} \in \R^{n\times p}$ of  real data (discrete or
continous), where $p$ is the number of  columns (variables) and $n$ is the
sample size (number of individuals). We assume the individuals are not related
and therefore the rows of ${\X}$ are independent.

For $j\in \{1,\dotsc, p\}$ we denote by ${\X}^{j}$ the $j$th column of ${\bf
X}$ and given an interval of contiguous variables $I\subset\{1,\dotsc, p\}$ we
denote by ${\X}_I$ the sub-matrix with columns corresponding to elements of
$I$.

In this context we assume there is a sequence of intervals (a partition)
$S_0=\{I_1,\dotsc, I_k\}$ covering the entire range of variables  such that  the
distribution of ${\X}$ is `homogeneous` inside each block $I$, that is
${\X}^j_i \sim f_{I(j)} \quad\text{ for all }i=1,\dotsc, n$, where $I(j)$ is
the unique interval in $S_0$ containing  marker $j$.

The function  $f_{I(j)}$ represents a density function in the case of continuous
random variables or a probability mass function in the case of discrete random
variables.  Moreover we assume the sequence $S_0=\{I_1,\dots, I_k\}$ is
`minimal` in the sense that we can not merge two sub-sequent intervals and
obtain an equivalent model. This is equivalent to assume that
$f_{I_\ell}\neq f_{I_{\ell+1}}$ for all $\ell=1, \dots, k-1$.

Observe that we are not assuming independence between the columns of ${\X}$,
this is an additional assumption that depends on the specific application.
Moreover, the independence between the rows of ${\X}$ could also be ignored,
but we assume it by simplicity.
