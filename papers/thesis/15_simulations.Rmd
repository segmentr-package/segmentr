# Simulations

In order to exemplify the utility of this package, a handful of hypothetical
data will be presented, together with a proposal of an appropriate likelihood
function that is expected to segment the data in an expected manner.

## Correlated random variables

Let $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_n$ be random variable observations, with each $X_k$,
with $1 \le k \le n$, representing a set of observations from a different
random variable with $m$ observations in each set, represented by
$X_k = \{x_{k1},\ x_{k2},\ ...,\ x_{km}\}$.
Also, let $Eq_1$, $Eq_2$, ..., $Eq_N$ be $N$ equations which specify
relationships between the points arbitrary random variables. Therefore, build
the data matrix $D$ with each set of observations $X_k$ in each column.

$$D = [x_{ij}]$$
