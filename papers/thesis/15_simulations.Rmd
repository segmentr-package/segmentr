# Simulations

In order to exemplify the utility of this package, a handful of hypothetical
data will be presented, together with a proposal of an appropriate likelihood
function that is expected to segment the data in an expected manner.

## Correlated random variables

Let $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_n$ be random variable observations, with each $X_k$,
with $1 \le k \le n$, representing a set of observations from a different
random variable with $m$ observations in each set, represented by
$X_k = \{x_{k1},\ x_{k2},\ ...,\ x_{km}\}$.
Also, let $Eq_1$, $Eq_2$, ..., $Eq_N$ be $N$ equations which specify
relationships between the points arbitrary random variables. Therefore, build
the data matrix $D$ with each set of observations $X_k$ in each column.

$$
D = [x_{ij}], 1 \le i \le m \text{ and } 1 \le j \le n
(\#eq:multivariatedata)
$$

Let $C(D)$ be the set of changepoints that split \@ref(eq:multivariatedata) in
changepoints with maximum likelihood. If the maximum likelihood of a discrete
multivariate distribution is used, the set of changepoints in the data will be
defined by the $Eq_k$, with $1 \le k \le N$, for which there are no common
random variables relationships defined in each sequence of continuous equations
relationships. In other words, $C(D)$ will be the points that split $D$ in
segments of random variables independent of each other.

To give an example, assume 

```{r}
# R code building the data
```

So, we use `segmentr` in order to find the expected segment points.
