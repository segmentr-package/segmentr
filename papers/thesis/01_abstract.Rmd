# Abstract

We describe the implementation of an R package focused in detecting changepoints
in a matrix dataset, according to segments that maximize the system's segment
likelihoods according to a given likelihood function, which dictate how we want
to segment the data, and a penalty function, which can be used to do changes.

This is the second paragraph.
